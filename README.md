# Movie-app

## About

Explored API documentation.

Created a decent UI where anyone should be able to search for any movie they want

Made a fetch request and get the data depending on whatever movie name entered.

Showed the movie data on the app.

If there is no valid movie of searched name, showed an error in the form of gif on the webpage.

If a movie is found, show the

    Movie Poster, 

    Release Date, 

    Title, 

    Ratings and 

    all the Important Info.
    
 If the IMDb rating of a searched movie is >8.5, showed a recommended tag in front of it.
